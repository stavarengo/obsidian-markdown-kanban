## Basic Rule

1. Keep this file small and thin. Only write here what a fresh LLM session **can't** rediscover on its own by reading the other files in this project. Keep each entry to a few words.
2. Always update the [`examples/`](./examples/) after introducing or changing anything that affect the user experience.

### Driving the Obsidian UI via the Chrome DevTools MCP server

2. Use the [`chrome-devtools-obsidian`](./.mcp.json) MCP server to debug, inspect UI, test behaviour, and whatnot directly in a real Obsidian instance running on the **host** OS.
   Do not use the global chrome-devtools plugin, which launches its own headless Chrome.
3. When running inside a container, ask your human to run the command below to set up the host bridge (Obsidian + socat) - replace the CONTAINER_IP with the actual container IP:
   ```bash title="This needs to be run on the host, not in the container"
   obsidian --remote-debugging-port=9222 --remote-debugging-address=0.0.0.0 
   socat TCP-LISTEN:9222,bind=CONTAINER_IP,fork,reuseaddr TCP:127.0.0.1:9222
   ```
4. When running inside a container, always inform your human when you could not test due to a missing host bridge (Obsidian + socat) and ask them to start/restart it. 
5. The default `take_snapshot` omits the file-explorer tree — use `verbose: true` to get folder/file nodes.
6. The header breadcrumb and the explorer both expose the folder name; clicking the breadcrumb only selects — click the explorer node to expand/open.
