# Showcase Board

The "kitchen-sink" board for **Folia Kanban** — it exercises every feature of the plugin in one place. Open `README.md` in this folder for the guided tour and the things to try (search queries, settings, drag, right-click).

Run **"Open Kanban board"** with this note focused, or click the layout-grid ribbon icon.
