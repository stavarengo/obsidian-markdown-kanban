# Fix keyboard-drag focus bug

Focus is lost after dropping with the keyboard. Repro: pick up with **Space**, move with the arrow keys, drop — focus jumps to the board root instead of the moved card.

## Subtasks
- [x] Reproduce reliably
- [ ] Restore focus to the moved card
- [ ] Add a regression test
